# Real Estate Price Predictor

The Real Estate Price Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the prices of real estate properties based on various features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. This tool aims to assist real estate agents, buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions by providing accurate price estimates.

## Features
- Predicts property prices based on multiple features including location, size, and amenities.
- Supports multiple regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions on new data.
- Includes data visualization tools to explore feature importance and model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes various features relevant to property pricing:
- Location (e.g., city, neighborhood)
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Age of the property
- Proximity to amenities (e.g., schools, shopping centers)
  
The dataset should be formatted as a CSV file and can be replaced with your own data. Make sure the dataset includes the necessary features required by the model.

## Usage

### Model Training
 It includes steps like:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning (optional)

### Prediction
The prediction script (`predict.py`) loads the trained model and applies it to new data to predict property prices. The script accepts a CSV file as input and outputs predicted prices.

## Results
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared Score

Evaluation results and model performance graphs are saved in the `results/` directory.
